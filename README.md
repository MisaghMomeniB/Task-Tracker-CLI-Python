### 1. **Imports and Constants**
```python
import os
import json
```
- **`os`**: This module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as checking file existence or reading/writing files.
- **`json`**: This module allows for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is commonly used for storing data in a human-readable format. In this case, it's used to save and load tasks from a file.

```python
TASK_FILE = "tasks.json"
```
- **`TASK_FILE`**: A constant that stores the file name (`tasks.json`) where the tasks will be saved.

### 2. **Load Tasks Function**
```python
def load_tasks():
    if os.path.exists(TASK_FILE):
        try:
            with open(TASK_FILE, "r") as file:
                return json.load(file)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            print("Error loading tasks. The file might be corrupted. Starting with an empty task list.")
            return []
    return []
```
- **`load_tasks()`**: This function loads the tasks from the file (`tasks.json`).
    - First, it checks if the file exists using `os.path.exists()`.
    - If the file exists, it tries to open the file in read mode (`"r"`), and uses `json.load(file)` to load the data from the file.
    - If there's an error (e.g., the file is corrupted), it catches the `json.JSONDecodeError` and prints an error message, returning an empty list of tasks.
    - If the file doesn’t exist, it simply returns an empty list.

### 3. **Save Tasks Function**
```python
def save_tasks(tasks):
    try:
        with open(TASK_FILE, "w") as file:
            json.dump(tasks, file, indent=4)
    except IOError:
        print("Error saving tasks. Please check file permissions.")
```
- **`save_tasks(tasks)`**: This function saves the current list of tasks to the file (`tasks.json`).
    - It opens the file in write mode (`"w"`) and uses `json.dump()` to write the tasks into the file in a formatted way (`indent=4` makes the JSON more readable).
    - If there is an error (e.g., due to file permissions), it catches the `IOError` and prints an error message.

### 4. **Display Tasks Function**
```python
def display_tasks(tasks):
    if not tasks:
        print("No tasks found!")
        return

    print("\nYour Tasks:")
    for index, task in enumerate(tasks):
        status = "✔️" if task["completed"] else "❌"
        print(f"{index + 1}. {task['title']} [{status}]")
```
- **`display_tasks(tasks)`**: This function displays the list of tasks with their status.
    - If the task list is empty, it prints "No tasks found!" and returns.
    - Otherwise, it iterates over the tasks and displays each one. The task's completion status is shown as a checkmark (`✔️`) if it’s completed or a cross (`❌`) if not.

### 5. **Add Task Function**
```python
def add_task(tasks):
    title = input("Enter the task title: ").strip()
    if title:
        tasks.append({"title": title, "completed": False})
        print(f"Task '{title}' added!")
    else:
        print("Task title cannot be empty.")
```
- **`add_task(tasks)`**: This function adds a new task to the list.
    - It prompts the user to input the title of the task. If the title is not empty, a new task is created as a dictionary with a `"title"` and a `"completed"` status set to `False`.
    - If the title is empty, it informs the user that the title cannot be empty.

### 6. **Mark Task Complete Function**
```python
def mark_task_complete(tasks):
    display_tasks(tasks)
    if not tasks:
        return

    try:
        task_number = int(input("Enter the task number to mark as complete: ")) - 1
        if 0 <= task_number < len(tasks):
            tasks[task_number]["completed"] = True
            print(f"Task '{tasks[task_number]['title']}' marked as complete!")
        else:
            print("Invalid task number.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number.")
```
- **`mark_task_complete(tasks)`**: This function allows the user to mark a task as completed.
    - It first displays the current list of tasks using `display_tasks()`.
    - Then, it asks the user to input the number of the task they want to mark as complete. The input is adjusted by subtracting 1 because lists are zero-indexed.
    - If the number is valid (i.e., within the range of existing tasks), the task is marked as complete by setting the `"completed"` field to `True`.
    - If the input is invalid (not a number or out of range), it handles the error gracefully by printing a message.

### 7. **Main Menu Function**
```python
def main():
    tasks = load_tasks()
    while True:
        print("\n--- Task Tracker ---")
        print("1. View Tasks")
        print("2. Add Task")
        print("3. Mark Task as Complete")
        print("4. Exit")

        choice = input("Enter your choice: ").strip()

        if choice == "1":
            display_tasks(tasks)
        elif choice == "2":
            add_task(tasks)
            save_tasks(tasks)
        elif choice == "3":
            mark_task_complete(tasks)
            save_tasks(tasks)
        elif choice == "4":
            save_tasks(tasks)
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```
- **`main()`**: The main function that drives the program.
    - It starts by loading tasks from the file using `load_tasks()`.
    - A `while` loop is used to display the menu options repeatedly until the user chooses to exit.
    - The user is prompted to input a choice:
        - **Option 1**: View tasks by calling `display_tasks()`.
        - **Option 2**: Add a new task using `add_task()` and then save the tasks with `save_tasks()`.
        - **Option 3**: Mark a task as complete using `mark_task_complete()` and save tasks afterward.
        - **Option 4**: Exit the program, saving the tasks before closing.
    - If the user enters an invalid option, the program asks them to try again.

### 8. **Program Execution Check**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
- **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: This ensures that the `main()` function is called when the script is run directly. It prevents the `main()` function from running if the file is imported as a module into another script.
